1.A common problem with float-based layouts is that the floats' container 
doesn't want to stretch up to accomodate the floats. If you want to add, say,
a border around all floats (ie. a border around the container) you'll have to
command the browsers somehow to stretch up the container all the way.



2.Use float when you want to pull an element to the side of
 a containing element while allowing other content to freely
  flow around it.


3.flex- Being one-dimensional, Flexbox only deals with either 
columns or rows. This system works for smaller layouts, but 
cannot render complex displays such as text or document-centric
properties that enable floats and columns.

4.One of the major drawbacks of using flexbox is performance issues.
 The use of flexbox 
can increase the page loading time if you have a larger project.
